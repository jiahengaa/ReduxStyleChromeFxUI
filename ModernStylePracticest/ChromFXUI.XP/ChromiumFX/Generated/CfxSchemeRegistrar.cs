        /// Section 2.1 of RFC 1123. These URLs will be canonicalized to
        /// "scheme://host/path" in the simplest case and

        /// example, "scheme:host/path" and "scheme:///host/path" will both be
        /// canonicalized to "scheme://host/path". The origin of a standard scheme URL
        /// is the combination of scheme, host and port (i.e., "scheme://host:port" in
        /// the most explicit case).
        /// For non-standard scheme URLs only the "scheme:" component is parsed and
        /// canonicalized. The remainder of the URL will be passed to the handler as-
        /// is. For example, "scheme:///some%20text" will remain the same. Non-standard
        /// scheme URLs cannot be used as a target for form submission.
        /// If |isLocal| is true (1) the scheme will be treated as local (i.e., with
        /// the same security rules as those applied to "file" URLs). Normal pages
        /// cannot link to or access local URLs. Also, by default, local URLs can only
        /// perform XMLHttpRequest calls to the same URL (origin + path) that
        /// originated the request. To allow XMLHttpRequest calls from a local URL to
        /// other URLs with the same origin set the
        /// CfxSettings.FileAccessFromFileUrlsAllowed value to true (1). To allow
        /// XMLHttpRequest calls from a local URL to all origins set the
        /// CfxSettings.UniversalAccessFromFileUrlsAllowed value to true (1).
        /// If |isDisplayIsolated| is true (1) the scheme will be treated as display-
        /// isolated. This means that pages cannot display these URLs unless they are
        /// from the same scheme. For example, pages in another origin cannot create
        /// iframes or hyperlinks to URLs with this scheme.

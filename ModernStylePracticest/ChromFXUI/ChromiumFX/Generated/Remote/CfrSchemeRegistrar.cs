        /// If |isStandard| is true (1) the scheme will be treated as a standard
        /// scheme. Standard schemes are subject to URL canonicalization and parsing
        /// rules as defined in the Common Internet Scheme Syntax RFC 1738 Section 3.1
        /// available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt
        /// 
        /// In particular, the syntax for standard scheme URLs must be of the form:
        /// &lt;pre>
        ///  [scheme]://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[url-path]
        /// &lt;/pre> Standard scheme URLs must have a host component that is a fully
        /// qualified domain name as defined in Section 3.5 of RFC 1034 [13] and
        /// Section 2.1 of RFC 1123. These URLs will be canonicalized to
        /// "scheme://host/path" in the simplest case and
        /// "scheme://username:password@host:port/path" in the most explicit case. For
        /// example, "scheme:host/path" and "scheme:///host/path" will both be
        /// canonicalized to "scheme://host/path". The origin of a standard scheme URL
        /// is the combination of scheme, host and port (i.e., "scheme://host:port" in
        /// the most explicit case).
        /// 
        /// For non-standard scheme URLs only the "scheme:" component is parsed and
        /// canonicalized. The remainder of the URL will be passed to the handler as-
        /// is. For example, "scheme:///some%20text" will remain the same. Non-standard
        /// scheme URLs cannot be used as a target for form submission.
        /// 
        /// If |isLocal| is true (1) the scheme will be treated with the same security
        /// rules as those applied to "file" URLs. Normal pages cannot link to or
        /// access local URLs. Also, by default, local URLs can only perform
        /// XMLHttpRequest calls to the same URL (origin + path) that originated the
        /// request. To allow XMLHttpRequest calls from a local URL to other URLs with
        /// the same origin set the CfrSettings.FileAccessFromFileUrlsAllowed
        /// value to true (1). To allow XMLHttpRequest calls from a local URL to all
        /// origins set the CfrSettings.UniversalAccessFromFileUrlsAllowed value
        /// to true (1).
        /// 
        /// If |isDisplayIsolated| is true (1) the scheme can only be displayed from
        /// other content hosted with the same scheme. For example, pages in other
        /// origins cannot create iframes or hyperlinks to URLs with the scheme. For
        /// schemes that must be accessible from other schemes set this value to false
        /// (0), set |isCorsEnabled| to true (1), and use CORS "Access-Control-Allow-
        /// Origin" headers to further restrict access.
        /// 
        /// If |isSecure| is true (1) the scheme will be treated with the same
        /// security rules as those applied to "https" URLs. For example, loading this
        /// scheme from other secure schemes will not trigger mixed content warnings.
        /// 
        /// If |isCorsEnabled| is true (1) the scheme can be sent CORS requests. This
        /// value should be true (1) in most cases where |isStandard| is true (1).
        ///

    /// WaitableEvent is a thread synchronization tool that allows one thread to wait
    /// for another thread to finish some work. This is equivalent to using a
    /// Lock+ConditionVariable to protect a simple boolean value. However, using
    /// WaitableEvent in conjunction with a Lock to wait for a more complex state
    /// change (e.g., for an item to be added to a queue) is not recommended. In that
    /// case consider using a ConditionVariable instead of a WaitableEvent. It is
    /// safe to create and/or signal a WaitableEvent from any thread. Blocking on a
    /// WaitableEvent by calling the *wait() functions is not allowed on the browser
    /// process UI or IO threads.
